                            <p class="text-muted mt-4">Since 1900, climate-induced sea-level rise has heightend global waters approximately 8 inches, inducing increased storm intensities and wide scale flooding in low-lying communities. Modern projections place another 12-inches of sea-level rise above the year 2000’s global sea averages. By 2100, we could see the oceans rise up to 2.5 meters. Such a rise would destroy low-altitude urban environments causing immeasurable economic, cultural, and environmental damage.</p>
                            <p class="text-muted mt-2">Many communities have already borne witness to the devastating impacts of sea-level rise. Climatic events are only expected to increase in size and frequency, meaning we must begin preparing our communities for rising tides today. Hence, this City Planner's Introductory Guide to Sea Level Rise was developed to assist those developing our cities begin their research in how to prepare their communities.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted mt-4">Accommodation and Coastal Defenses refer to the necessary steps we must take to greenify / weatherize our communities and protect our coastlines, respectfully. We refer to these steps as <i>interim</i> solutions because they do not fully protect us from the far-reaching impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. Rather, they are practices we must incorporate into our larger struggle to stop the progress of climate change and reach a carbon neutral society.</p>

                                        <p class="text-muted mt-4">When developing sustainable infrastructure, it is important to consider its long-term flexibility in an unpredictable climate. An inflexible, static structure that alleviates tidal pressures today may be detrimental in the long-term. A permanent sea-wall, for instance, may block crashing waves today, but it may fail in twenty years when the average sea-level has risen and storm intensity has increased. Instead, it is vital to have infrastrucutre that can be expanded upon. If the sea-wall can be heightened, your community can take appropriate action. If the sea-wall is immutable, your community will be forced to expend the resources to replace it entirely or suffer the infrastructure's shortcomings.</p>
                                        <p class="text-muted mt-2">The Netherlands, which has about a third of its country below sea level, has developed incredible flood control infrastructure using adaptive designs. The <i>Afsluitdijk</i>, for instance, servers as a non-static, 20-mile long dam protecting Amsterdam and the surrounding country side from storm surges originating in the North Sea. The dam was originally constructed in 1932 and sucessfully kept Amsterdam's port above local sea-levels. However, as the North Sea rose, pump stations and additional land had to be reserved to protect the country from intensifying storm surges. Now, the damn in undergoing a multi-year construction project to increase its size, add storm-breakers, and more. The Afsluitdijk is also being updated to include fish passages, renewable energy testing sites, and a safer, updated highway. From its inital contruction, the Dutch knew their designs would require modifications to meet changing demands. Their assumption paid off and now international communities should look to their work for inspiration on how to build their own sustainable infrastructure.</p>

                                        <p class="text-muted mt-4">As storms intensify and sea-levels rise, we need to make sure our low-lying infrastructure is prepared for flooding and hurricane-like events. Urban and developed areas retain water easily. Unlike rural areas which allow for runoff, urban centers have concrete, pavement, and other building materials that prevent water from dispersing evenly across the land. Instead, water is unable to permeate these building materials which can rapidly lead to flooding.</p>
                                        <p class="text-muted mt-2">To prevent these dangerous flooding events, we can develop green infrastructure. Rain gardens are a well known and easy to implement solution. They are usually shallow patches of grass with dense vegetation that are efficient in absorbing water. They can be both functional and aestitically pleasing. They can easily be constructed on the sides of parking lots, inbetween buildings, or as a fixture in a buildings entrance. Smaller vegetated areas can line steets and even turn your rooftops into practical gardens. It is additionally important to reserve larger swaths of green space as parks and other community sites. These not only assist with water dispersion but also improve a community's overall health and well-being. Finally, a community can build infrastructure with permeable surfaces to reduce the threat of flooding all together. Porous asphalt, for instance, will allow water to permeate the ground and lessen the likelihood floods.</p>
                                        <p class="text-muted mt-2">Simple measures can also be taken to protect our infrastructure from hurricanes and other storm like conditions. Installing impact resistant door and windows, or raising buildings on stilts are just some of the ways we can protect our infrastructure and homes from strong storms. Not long ago, the The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety created a standard to designate homes as "fortified". According to the University of Alabama, homes that meet this standard sell for 7% more while only requiring $1,000 to $5,000 more in contruction costs.</p>

                                        <p class="text-muted mt-4">Rising sea-levels and more frequent storms are also degrading shorlines and pushing storm surges deeper into our communities. Stories of flooded subway systems or water damaged homes are becoming more frequent along the United State's eastern coastline. To protect against these surges, many cities are being forced to build sea-walls to keep the ocean waves at bay. However, sea-walls can be incredibly expensive to build and maintain, and many smaller communities cannot afford the investment. Thankfully, many hard and soft engineering solutions are being developed to better suit a community's unique needs.</p>
                                        <p class="text-muted mt-2">Hard engineering solutions are human-made structres that have high envrionmental impact and  costs associated. Sea-walls serve as a great example. They require a heavy financial investment and distort the natural landscape. While they are effective at reflecting wave energy, they keep the waters choppy and will likely need to be heightened in the future. Groynes are used to prevent horizontal water movement along a beach and reduce erosion. They are, likewise, expensive and unnatractive. Gabions are essentially caged bouldered dropped along coast lines to reduce the impact of waves on the infrastructure behind them. They are effective, but are similarly expensive and unnapealing. There are many other forms of coastal hard engineering that may better fit a community's uniqe needs.</p>
                                        <p class="text-muted mt-2">Soft engineering solutions work to emphasize the protective nature of local envrionemnts. They often sustainable and require a smaller upfront investment than hard enginnering solutions. However, they can demand frequent and long-term maintenance. Beach nourishment or replacement, for example, is an effective way to protect coastlines by replenishing beaches with sand after they have expirienced erosion. The benefit of beach bourishment is two fold. Firstly, beaches are an excellent natural coastal defender. Large sand dunes are often all a local community needs to protect them from average storms. Secondly, maintaing a healthy beach attracts toursits and improves the well-being of its local community. Replenishing an area's sand is also relatively inexpensive, although it requires constant maitence.</p>

                                        <p class="text-muted mt-4">There is so much more to discuss when it comes to adapting our communities for sea-level rise and climate change. It's important to note that the topics briefly discussed on this page do not provide the reader with enough information to develop a robust response to sea-level rise for their community. Instead, more direct research into each of the topics and more is required. Some more topics to research include, but are not limited to, how to effiecently allign you community's response to sea-level rise with that of surounding and superseding governments, how to effectivley fund these operations, how to consider sustainable infrastrucutre's social and envrionmental impacts, and how to identify areas in most need of support.</p>
                                        <p class="text-muted mt-2">Fianally, there are two more approaches that must be mentioned in the international figtht against sea-level rise and climate change. To begin, climate change mitigation is a must. The world can spend trillions of dollars accomodating for climate change, but it would all be wasted if we continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmposhere. Mitigation deserves a larger conversation, but for the purposes of this website, remebr to consider ways to reduce your community's carbon footrprint while you prepare it for sea-level rise. Secondly, your community may face the unfortunate reality of needing to abanndom some of its land and even devloped areas. It is possible that the ocean may rise too quickly or that the financial burden of accomodating your community is too much. In these cases, a solemn community discussion on how to move to more elevated lands may be necessary. Going forward, be wary on an area's potentiel to become inundated by the sea before you develop it. It would be unwise to invest in land that will need to be abandoned. </p>
